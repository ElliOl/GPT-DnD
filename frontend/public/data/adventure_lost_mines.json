The sun is high overhead, and the journey has been uneventful so far. Gundren Rockseeker, a dwarf prospector, hired you to escort a wagon of supplies to Phandalin. He rode ahead with his escort, Sildar Hallwinter, promising to meet you in Phandalin.\n\nAs you round a bend in the trail, you come upon a disturbing sight: two dead horses blocking the path, black-feathered arrows protruding from their bodies. The horses belong to Gundren and Sildar.\n\nWhat do you do?",
